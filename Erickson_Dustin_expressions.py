# Homework Problem 1
# I wrote the expressions out as two different variables of "x". X1 is for part a, and X2 is for part b. I then chose to convert
# both results into strings. I then printed them, and made them look nice.


x1 = ((2 ** 4) + 7 - (3 * 4)) / 5 #This is the expression for part a. 
x2 = ((1 + (3 ** 2)) * (16 % 7)) / 7 #This is the expression for part b.

print("Solutions: ")
print("a. " + str(x1)) # I printed the results for part a to make it easier for you to validate the answer.
print("b. " + str(x2)) # I printed the results for part b to make it easier for you to validate the answer.
