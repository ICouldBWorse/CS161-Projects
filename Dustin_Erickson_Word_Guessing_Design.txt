The word guessing game I would like to make is a game based on Wheel of Fortune and Hangman. The program would start by printing the rules
to the console for the player to read, and then asking them to type "y" if they are ready to continue. Once the user types "y", the program 
will randomly select a word from a list of 10-20 words. The user starts with $1000. Then it will ask the user to "spin" by typing "spin".
If spin is typed, the program will select a random amount of money between two bounds. It will then print this amount and it will print and an 
x for each letter in the word. After, it will ask the user to guess a character. If the character appears in the word, the user gets the 
listed amount of money for each charater they get right. If a player gets one wrong, then they loose $500. If they run out of money before they
finish the word then they loose.
