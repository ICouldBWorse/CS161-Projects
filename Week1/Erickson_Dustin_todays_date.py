#I used the module "datetime" to import the class date. I then used the variable "currentDate" to store today's date. I then put that in a print
#function, turned the variable into a string, and concatanated that with text.



from datetime import date #Importing the module and class

currentDate = date.today() #The date variable container


print("Today's date is: " + str(currentDate)) # Print function with string function
